<h3>Moana 1</h3>

<p>"Moana" would have been enormously entertaining regardless of when it came out, 
    but its arrival at this particular moment in history gives it an added sense of 
    significanceâ€”as well as inspiration.</p>

<h3>Cruella</h3> 
<p>There's no denying that "Cruella" is stylish and kinetic, with a nasty edge that's unusual for a recent Disney live-action feature. 
    But it's also exhausting, disorganized, and frustratingly inert, considering how hard it works to assure you that it's thrilling and cheeky. 
    You get forty minutes into it and realize the main story hasn't started yet.</p>  

<h3>Emily in Paris</h3>
<p>Bland Sex and the City Imitation with No Identity of Its Own</p>
